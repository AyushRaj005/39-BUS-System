# 39-Bus Power System in PSS®E

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the modeling and analysis of the **39-Bus New England Power System** using **Siemens PSS®E (Power System Simulator for Engineering)**. The 39-bus system is a widely used benchmark in power system research and education due to its complexity and practical representation of real-world grid behavior.

The project covers:

* Creation of the single-line diagram of the 39-bus system.
* Integration of generators, loads, and transmission lines.
* Performing load flow analysis and validation.
* Preparing the system model for advanced studies such as stability, fault analysis, and contingency evaluation.

## ⚡ Objectives

* To **design and implement** the IEEE 39-bus (New England) system in PSS®E.
* To **simulate load flow studies** and analyze system performance.
* To provide a **standard test model** for further research in power systems.
